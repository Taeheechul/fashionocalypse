# FASHIONCALYPSE

### What this project does
This is a game where you gather clothes in a post-apocalyptic world before 
Kim Kardashian paid fashion zombies can stop you.


### How we built it
We used [Phaser](http://phaser.io) for the game engine and a dash of jQuery


### Challenges we ran into
we were not able to get the code to run and we were not able to find images to use for the game
* Collision was a nightmare(words from the developer)
* We had to disband on the idea of bullets since it was another nightmare(*cough* this is the developer speaking)


### What we learned
we learned to use [Phaser](http://phaser.io) 


### What is next for this project?
the next for this project is to add more levels and show messages from the boss, Kim
